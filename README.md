# autoMod

## **About**
autoMod is a fun and easy to use Discord Bot that is designed to keep your server a safe and enjoyable place for all members. It comes with many features: such as a toggle on/off `word-filter` and `Ghost Ping Detector`!

autoMod comes from the developer of verfied bot: [Coin Flipper#1767](https://coinflipperbot.glitch.me) and npm package: [discord.js-ghost-ping](https://npmjs.com/package/discord.js-ghost-ping)

### Why autoMod?
There are many other **verified** moderation bots out there, so why choose autoMod? It's true there are many bots but very few provide the features that autoMod has: the State-of-the-Art [Ghost Ping Detector](https://npmjs.com/package/discord.js-ghost-ping) and word-filter system for example!
