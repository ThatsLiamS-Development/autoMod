# autoMod

autoMod is a state-of-the-art moderation bot for Discord that is designed to make managing a server easy and efficient. The bot is equipped with powerful features that allow for automatic deletion of messages containing specific keywords or phrases, ban or kick of users who violate the server's rules, and logging of all moderated actions for easy reference and accountability. 

The bot can be easily installed by inviting it to your server via the [provided link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=782985846474932315&permissions=8&scope=applications.commands%20bot) and configured using the available slash commands. Additionally, it has a **[support server](https://discord.gg/2je9aJynqt)** and an **[open-source GitHub repository](https://github.com/ThatsLiamS/autoMod)** where users can report issues or contribute to its development. Overall, autoMod is a reliable and user-friendly solution for managing your Discord server effectively.
